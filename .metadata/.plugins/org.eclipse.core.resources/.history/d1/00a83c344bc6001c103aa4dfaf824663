Feature: To test services in https://bitly.com

Prereq: User has created an account in bitly and also created several links



Scenario Outline: To validate response body of GET/groups/{group_guid}/bitlinks/{sort}
			
Given user has generated "<token>" token for Authorization
When we perform  GET/groups/{group_guid}/bitlinks/{sort}
Then we get list of bitlinks sorted by group
And we validate whether detail "<key>" has value "<value>"

Examples:

|				token						|  	  key				|					value	   					   |
| ee5bc095f2c67d11c579b9750dd6fcef64bfe554	|	links.id			| [bit.ly/3L8ojHm, bit.ly/3xTcl0J, bit.ly/3vwyizy] |
| ee5bc095f2c67d11c579b9750dd6fcef64bfe554	|	sorted_links.id		| [bit.ly/3L8ojHm, bit.ly/3xTcl0J, bit.ly/3vwyizy] |
| ee5bc095f2c67d11c579b9750dd6fcef64bfe554	|	sorted_links.clicks	|              [2, 1, 1]   						   |
